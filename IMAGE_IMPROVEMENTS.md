# Restaurant Image Improvements

## Changes Made

1. **Created Image Utilities**
   - Added `imageUtils.js` with cuisine-specific restaurant images
   - Implemented image validation and fallback mechanisms
   - Created functions to get appropriate images based on restaurant type

2. **Added Reusable Image Components**
   - `RestaurantImage.js` - Handles restaurant images with error handling
   - `MenuItemImage.js` - Handles menu item images with category-specific fallbacks

3. **Improved CSS Styling**
   - Added `imageStyles.css` with proper image sizing and loading states
   - Added background colors to prevent empty spaces during loading
   - Implemented subtle animations for loading states

4. **Added Image Preloading**
   - Created `imagePreloader.js` to preload common restaurant images
   - Integrated preloading into the App component

5. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Added onError handlers to all images
   - Implemented fallback images for different categories
   - Ensured no empty or broken images are displayed

## Benefits

- **No Repeated Images**: Each restaurant now has a unique image based on its cuisine and ID
- **No Empty Images**: All images have proper fallbacks if the original fails to load
- **Better User Experience**: Preloading and loading states improve perceived performance
- **Consistent Styling**: All images maintain proper aspect ratios and sizes
- **Category-Specific Images**: Images are relevant to the restaurant's cuisine type

## How It Works

1. When displaying a restaurant, the system first tries to use the provided image
2. If the image fails to load or doesn't exist, it falls back to a cuisine-specific image
3. The cuisine-specific image is selected based on the restaurant's cuisine type
4. For menu items, category-specific images are used (Appetizers, Main Course, etc.)
5. All images are validated to ensure they come from reliable sources

This implementation ensures that all restaurant and menu images display properly without repetition or loading issues.
